# Bar√ßƒ±n Ersoy

Hi there! I'm Bar√ßƒ±n, a Game Design student with a passion for programming and electronics. I've been coding since high school, and while I enjoy the art of coding, I prefer keeping things simple‚ÄîI'm not quite crazy enough to dive into assembly language, though! 

By day, I'm a programmer, but by night, I dive into the world of electronics. My true passion lies in networking‚ÄîI love how machines communicate with each other, whether it's in games, real-time communications, or electronic systems.

I‚Äôm drawn to the dynamics of interpreted languages, but my heart lies with compiled languages since they run on their own.
